This guide contains all the links you'll need for the Remote Execution with XCM Workshop - so you only have to scan 1 QR code at the beginning. We won't assume any pre-existing account setup, so we will start from a blank slate. 

### Initial Setup

1. [Install MetaMask](https://metamask.io/)
2. [Add Moonbase Alpha Network to MetaMask](https://docs.moonbeam.network/)
3. [Get funds from the faucet](https://apps.moonbeam.network/moonbase-alpha/faucet/)
4. [Swap some (not all) DEV tokens for xcUNITS](https://moonbeam-swap.netlify.app/#/swap)

### Calculating a Sovereign Address
- [Clone the xcmTools repo](https://github.com/albertov19/xcmTools)
- [Shawn Tabrizi's Utilities](https://www.shawntabrizi.com/substrate-js-utilities/)
